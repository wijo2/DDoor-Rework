# DDoor-Rework
This readme is written for the demo release, which is only modded from the start until grandma through the straightest path. (no silent servants)

Installation instructions are at the bottom, but you should read the file through before playing.

### Very important to read changes
Weapons have been completely reworked. The uncharged heavy is now the basic attack, and as such it's stats are shown in the weapons menu at bottom right. The light attacks have an unique function for each weapon, so be sure to read the weapon descriptions and experiment.

Light attacks can no longer deflect bullets unless otherwise stated, only heavies have that ability by default.

Spells deal 1 damage base, which is pretty high, so be sure to use them.

On the main menu you can bind a button to switch between the current and most recently used weapon, make sure it's easily accessible, you are expected to swap weapons mid-combat. (mostly to umbrella as of now.) Though the bind isn't saved between sessions, and the recent weapon isn't saved between rooms/death, sorry for the inconveniance, I'll fix it later but these take some time to solve.

### general tips/mindset
This mod is VERY hard, death is expected, and it is completely ok to die a lot. it took me, wijo, the dev and a speedrunner, over 5h to beat grandma for instance.

You should treat this mod as a challenge run. Aside from obviously broken cheese such as shooting bosses before entering the arena, skipping things, and glitches, everything is fair game.

After you die, think strategically. How could I have dodged that? Was this the best weapon to use in this situation? Could I kill the enemies in a better order?

And if this doesn't sound like fun to you, disregard everything I've said and do whatever you want with the mod. I don't care.

### Installation
step 1: make sure you have the debug mod installed (you can get it from here: https://github.com/PrestonRooker/DDoorDebugMod), you can disable it if you want to by moving the game/BepInEx/plugins/DDoorDebug.dll file *outside* of the plugins folder, but make sure to keep the wfshader.bundle file in the folder.
step 2: go to https://github.com/wijo2/DDoor-Rework/releases and download the .net v.4.5.2 file, and drag it into the aftermentioned plugins folder.
step 3: boot up the game, if you see the bind gui for weapon switch at the top left of the title screen that means it has been successfully installed. If not however, try the other file on the releases page, the first suggested version doesn't work for everyone.
